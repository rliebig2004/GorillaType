## Improve your Accuracy and Typing Speed
\
***What will the application do?*** \
An interactive application for increasing accuracy and typing speed is the proposed project. 
It will work as an app-based platform where users can practice typing to improve their accuracy and speed. Users will 
need to type precisely and quickly as this application will produce random phrases or sentences. They will also 
receive a thorough report afterwards, detailing their words-per-second (WPS) and accuracy percentage after completing a 
customizable word count, such as 20 words or more.

***Who will use it?*** \
The variety of people with different backgrounds, both professional or not, who could use this tool frequently include:
- Journalists who want to improve their typing speeds, so that they can focus more on their journalistic material.
- Accountants who want to improve their word accuracy, to improve the accuracy of their finance reports.
- Transcriptionists who want to improve their word accuracy when reporting court or other transcripts.
- Students who want to grow better at taking notes. 
- Etc.

Potential users range from ages between 17 to 60, including both students and professionals in the workforce.

***Why is this project of interest to you?*** \
As a student, I used to have difficulties keeping up with my classes due to taking notes on pen and paper. It was highly 
inefficient and resulted in inaccurate notes being taken. Hence, why I recently switched to electronic note-taking, 
specifically on my laptop. In order to improve my notes, practicing on typing faster and accurately at the same time
are important. Therefore, this app was designed to do exactly that; so students, like myself, can train themselves to 
improve their typing speed and accuracy for multiple reasons such as note-taking, coding, and many others. This would 
also help people in other fields such as the ones I stated beforehand; journalists, accountants, transcriptionists, etc. 
You can even compare your skills with your friends and family, fun game idea, right? It's applications are endless and 
it might be even helpful for you too! 

## User Story
- I want to be able to generate random words to create random statements and phrases for the application.
- I want to be able to type in words into the application, matching the sentences/ phrases that the app has generated.
- I want to be able to calculate the words-per-second value (WPS) and accuracy percentage.
- I want to be able to track the user's best time, WPM, and accuracy every round; 
  adds it as a new attempt to the scoreboard.
- I want to be able to print the scoreboard that holds each user's attempt
- I want to be given the option to save my attempts to file or not when I finish a round.
- I want to be given the option to load my attempts list from file when I start the application.

## Instructions
- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by 
**pressing the "Save" button after you finish a round, it will save that new entry to the scoreboard.**
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by 
**pressing the "Load Progress" on the Menu Page, it will show you all the entries that were added onto the scoreboard.**
- You can locate my visual component by **running the game from the Main class**
- You can save the state of my application by **pressing the "Save" button**
- You can reload the state of my application by **pressing the "Load Progress" button**

## Future Improvements
In the hypothetical case of having more time to do this project, I would've designed
a special class to handle the GUI components' look and styling. Attributes like colors,
sizes, fonts, and other visual characteristics could be contained in this class.
I could make all of the styling selections in one location.
By doing this, it would be simpler to manage and alter the application's visual elements,
without effecting the entire GUI class' functionality.\

For simplicity, let's refer to this class as "GUIStyleManager". To obtain the necessary stylistic information, 
each GUI class would just call methods or access properties from the GUIStyleManager, 
rather than specifying its own colors and sizes. In design terms, by adhering to the 
Single Responsibility Principle, this separation of concerns improves the general modularity of the program. 
Although this refactoring adds a new class, it offers a better organized and adaptable framework for managing the GUI's 
visual elements.
