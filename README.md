## Improve your Accuracy and Typing Speed
\
***What will the application do?*** \
An interactive application for increasing accuracy and typing speed is the proposed project. 
It will work as an app-based platform where users can practice typing to improve their accuracy and speed. Users will 
need to type precisely and quickly as this application will produce random phrases or sentences. They will also 
receive a thorough report afterwards, detailing their words-per-second (WPS) and accuracy percentage after completing a 
customizable word count, such as 20 words or more.

***Who will use it?*** \
The variety of people with different backgrounds, both professional or not, who could use this tool frequently include:
- Journalists who want to improve their typing speeds, so that they can focus more on their journalistic material.
- Accountants who want to improve their word accuracy, to improve the accuracy of their finance reports.
- Transcriptionists who want to improve their word accuracy when reporting court or other transcripts.
- Students who want to grow better at taking notes. 
- Etc.

Potential users range from ages between 17 to 60, including both students and professionals in the workforce.

***Why is this project of interest to you?*** \
As a student, I used to have difficulties keeping up with my classes due to taking notes on pen and paper. It was highly 
inefficient and resulted in inaccurate notes being taken. Hence, why I recently switched to electronic note-taking, 
specifically on my laptop. In order to improve my notes, practicing on typing faster and accurately at the same time
are important. Therefore, this app was designed to do exactly that; so students, like myself, can train themselves to 
improve their typing speed and accuracy for multiple reasons such as note-taking, coding, and many others. This would 
also help people in other fields such as the ones I stated beforehand; journalists, accountants, transcriptionists, etc. 
You can even compare your skills with your friends and family, fun game idea, right? It's applications are endless and 
it might be even helpful for you too!
